# BlackVault — Terminal Domination Toolkit

> **Built by Bandz & Ms. Joplin**  
> Digital rebels. Code demons. System whisperers.

---

**BlackVault** is a custom-built, bash-based hacking arsenal developed natively for Termux.  
This toolkit was made with purpose: not just to *look* cool, but to *do damage* — legally, ethically, and educationally, of course.

From card manipulation ideas to Android PIN cracking simulations, from RFID toolkits to car tech experimentation —  
**BlackVault** is your all-in-one system breacher. Clean, sexy, lethal.

## Features

- **Card Tools** – Luhn validation, format checkers, and more (expanding!)
- **Android PIN Cracker** – Brute force simulator for educational use
- **Car Hacking Concepts** – CAN bus sniffer logic, diagnostic modules, etc.
- **RFID Toolkit** – Tag scanning, clone potential (via libnfc/dev modules)
- **Menu Automation** – Bash-powered number-input navigation
- **Native Termux Feel** – 100% bash, minimal dependencies
